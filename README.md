# portfolio : 
On this project i will demostrate my abilities to create a website and special effects to it

#  Header:
on the header i used three workable links ( twitter, linkedin, email). those three links are fully functional, meaning when you clicked on them they take you to the corresponding box.

# the 3 boxes:

Twitter box: i wanted to play with the text-shadows to give a different feel to it. on the box i also did a blurry box-shadow effect.

linkedin box: i left the text plain to put more focus on the box-shadow effects. On this one I use two different box-shadow effects to add rainbow like effect to the box

Email: On this box i used the hover effect. When you hover the email box the image will enlarge and take a different shape with different elemments.

# footer:

on the footer i place two linkes "Twitter" and "Linkedin". when you click on them they will redirect you  to those website.
